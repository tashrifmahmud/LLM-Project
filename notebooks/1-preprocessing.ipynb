It’s the first Friday of the month, when for one ever-so-brief moment the interests of Wall Street, Washington and Main Street are all aligned on one thing: Jobs. \\n \\n A fresh update on the U.S. employment situation for January hits the wires at 8:30 a.m. New York time offering one of the most important snapshots on how the economy fared during the previous month. Expectations are for 203,000 new jobs to be created, according to economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires, compared to 227,000 jobs added in February. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 8.3%. \\n \\n Here at MarketBeat HQ, we’ll be offering color commentary before and after the data crosses the wires. Feel free to weigh-in yourself, via the comments section. And while you’re here, why don’t you sign up to follow us on Twitter. \\n \\n Enjoy the show. ||||| Employers pulled back sharply on hiring last month, a reminder that the U.S. economy may not be growing fast enough to sustain robust job growth. The unemployment rate dipped, but mostly because more Americans stopped looking for work. \\n \\n The Labor Department says the economy added 120,000 jobs in March, down from more than 200,000 in each of the previous three months. \\n \\n The unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent, the lowest since January 2009. The rate dropped because fewer people searched for jobs. The official unemployment tally only includes those seeking work. \\n \\n The economy has added 858,000 jobs since December _ the best four months of hiring in two years. But Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has cautioned that the current hiring pace is unlikely to continue without more consumer spending.',\n",

Patrick Healy reports for the NBC4 News at 6 on Friday, March 4, 2016. (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n Los Angeles police confirmed Friday morning a knife was found on the former Brentwood property of O.J. Simpson and said they are investigating a report that it was discovered years ago by a construction worker who handed it over to authorities. \\n \\n A report, published Friday by TMZ and citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said a construction worker found a knife several years ago buried on the perimeter of the former Simpson home and gave it to a police officer working security for a nearby film shoot. \\n \\n Archive: The O.J. Simpson Slow-Speed Chase On June 17, 1994, an apparently suicidal Orenthal \\\"OJ\\\" Simpson and his friend Al Cowlings led police on a 60 mile slow-speed car chase through Los Angeles and Orange counties, captivating viewers glued to television sets. Simpson had failed to surrender to police earlier in the day, when he was slated to be charged in the murders of his ex-wife and her male friend. As police closed down the freeways and 20 cruisers followed Simpson, spectators filled the freeway overpasses, many cheering him on with signs reading \\\"Go O.J.\\\" (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n The officer, now retired, was recently ordered to surrender the knife for testing by authorities after he contacted a friend at the department for information about the 1994 murder case for which Simpson stood trial, according to the report. \\n \\n LAPD Capt. Andrew Neiman told NBC4 Friday morning that police are investigating the report. \\n \\n The mansion on Rockingham Avenue in Brentwood, where Simpson lived when his ex-wife and her friend were stabbed to death in June 1994, was demolished by a new owner in 1998. TMZ reported, citing law enforcement sources, that the knife was found sometime from \\\"several years ago to 1998.\\\" \\n \\n The Great White Bronco Chase \\n \\n \\\"We still don't know if that's an accurate account,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n Neiman confirmed at a Friday morning news conference that an individual identified by the officer as a construction worker gave the knife to him when he was working security at a film shoot near the former Simpson estate. The officer retired in the late 1990s, but it's not clear whether the officer was retired at the time the knife was found, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"If this story is accurate, I would think an LAPD officer would know that anytime you come into contact with evidence you should submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\n \\n The officer will likely not face administrative charges because he is retired, Neiman said, adding that an investigation will determine whether criminal charges are possible. \\n \\n Life and Times: OJ Simpson \\n \\n Police became aware of the knife within the last month, but authorities did not discuss details about how they obtained the item. It has been submitted to an LAPD forensics team for examination. \\n \\n It was not clear to whom the knife belonged and authorities are attempting to determine the identity of the individual who turned it over to the officer, Neiman said. \\n \\n \\\"With all cases that remain open, unless there's an actual arrest or conviction to prove we've actually closed the case, the case remains open,\\\" Neiman said of the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. \\n \\n Neiman did not provide a description of the knife at the Friday news conference, but multiple law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told NBC News that the knife undergoing tests is a relatively inexpensive, smaller-bladed utility blade typically used by construction workers, gardeners, landscapers or other laborers. \\n \\n The murder weapon in the case has remained a mystery. A 15-inch retractable-blade knife that Simpson bought at Ross Cutlery in downtown Los Angeles drew the interest of murder trial prosecutors, but the defense presented the knife in a preliminary hearing. Tests later showed the knife in pristine condition with no signs it had been used in the double killing. \\n \\n LAPD Discusses Knife Found at Ex-OJ Simpson Home (Published Friday, March 4, 2016) \\n \\n In 1998, a residential construction crew found a folding-blade knife in Simpson's former neighborhood but police said there was no evidence to show it was related to any crime. \\n \\n The mansion, where Simpson married Brown in 1985, was one of the landmarks of the murder trial. The infamous white Ford Bronco pursuit from Orange County ended in the mansion's driveway. It's also where Det. Mark Fuhrman said he found a bloody glove during the investigation into the slayings of Brown and Goldman. \\n \\n Simpson was forced to sell the Rockingham Avenue estate to comply with requirements of the civil court judgment after the criminal trial. An investment banker hired a demolition crew to raze the house and clear the way for a new mansion four years later. \\n \\n \\\"It's not my house and I could care less,\\\" Simpson told The Associated Press in a telephone interview at the time the house was demolished. \\\"I am a sentimental guy, but there's things you've got to compartmentalize.\\\" \\n \\n The former NFL and USC football star was acquitted of murder in the slayings of ex-wife and Goldman, but a civil jury found him liable. In September 2007, Simpson was arrested in Las Vegas and charged with several felonies after an armed robbery and kidnapping at a hotel in an attempt to recover sports memorabilia. \\n \\n He was sentenced to 33 years in prison. \\n \\n OJ Trial: Key Players Then and Now \\n \\n No matter what is determined through the knife investigation, Simpson cannot be tried again in the Brown-Goldman murders because of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Attorney Carl Douglas, a member of Simpson's legal team that secured the 1995 acquittal, said an investigation involving the knife would be a waste of time and money. \\n \\n \\\"I am amazed at the latest frenzy surrounding this ridiculous frenzy about some knife found on OJ's former property,\\\" Douglas said. \\\"As a proud citizen of Los Angeles, I will be offended if the Los Angeles Police Department spends one minute of city time or one dollar of the city's limited resources chasing this ridiculous, supposed lead. I hope there are other investigations more deserving of the city's resources than this failed attempt, now 22 years old. \\n \\n \\\"OJ left the house two days after the murders and never returned until October 3rd, 1995. I certainly hope the LAPD used all of the resources then to scour every inch of his property looking for relevant evidence. It is pure fantasy to believe that there's anything relevant with this knife that has now been turned over. I'd rather talk about the Easter Bunny instead.\\\" ||||| ABC News reports investigators said preliminary information indicates the knife found on O.J. Simpson's old home is not the murder weapon in the killings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman.Capt. Andrew Neiman said the Los Angeles Police Department became aware of the item within the last month. It was allegedly recovered by a citizen at the property possibly around the time the site was demolished, which was in 1998.Trent Copeland, the attorney of retired officer George Maycott described the weapon as a 5-inch buck knife covered with dirt and mud. He said there were no obvious signs of blood on the knife. Law enforcement officials told ABC News the likely real murder weapon was bigger and possibly \\\"exotic.\\\"The item was found by a construction worker at the site, and he gave it to Maycott, who was working an off-duty movie job. Maycott, retired at the time, immediately called the West Los Angeles Police Department to tell them he was handed a knife, the attorney said. The person on the phone placed Maycott on hold, and said she spoke to a supervisor who said the case was over and there was nothing they could do due to double jeopardy, according to Copeland.Authorities said the retired officer held onto the knife and kept it in a tool box for 15 years until recently.Maycott's attorney said the retired officer was buying materials at the academy and asked someone for a records number on the Simpson case. Jokingly, Maycott decided to put the number on the knife and frame it. The weapon was taken into custody on Feb. 10 and Maycott did not resist, according to Copeland.\\\"I was really surprised. I would think that an LAPD officer - if this story is accurate as we're being told - would know that any time you come into contact with evidence that you should and shall submit that to investigators,\\\" Neiman said. \\\"I don't know what the circumstances are or why that didn't happen or if that's entirely accurate or if this whole story is possibly bogus from the get-go.\\\"The police department has asked for the citizen who turned over the knife to contact them.Authorities said they were still doing testing to check whether the weapon was connected to the murders. As part of the investigation, LAPD detectives were trying to piece together the timeline of exactly when the demolition of the property started and ended, and who obtained the knife and had possession of it from then until now, according to ABC News.Neiman said double jeopardy would be in place for Simpson.Simpson, a former football player, was acquitted of murder charges in the 1994 stabbings of his ex-wife and her friend. He is currently imprisoned in Nevada for a 2008 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction.Goldman's public relations firm, Garson & Wright Public Relations, Inc., released the following statement from Fred and Kim Goldman:\\\"Until the LAPD completes its investigation of the recovered knife, the validity of the knife as it relates to Ron and Nicole's murder is purely speculative. It is not a shock to our family that stories like this are making headlines again. Being a victim/survivor is an ongoing process for all those impacted. We cannot validate every claim with a discussion, as it only creates more unnecessary hype and encourages the media circus. \\\" ||||| Marcia Clark is opening up about reliving O.J.

I thank God that I\\u2019ve been placed in a position to represent women in a culture that is so male driven. And I want you to know this. I\\u2019m working on an album called the \\u2018Pink Print,\\u2019 but that\\u2019s not a plug, but it\\u2019s a plug.

But Minaj implying that Azalea doesn\\u2019t even write her own rhymes would make Azalea the prevailing Wizard of Oz of hip hop. Minaj basically stood up and said live, on national television, that Azalea\\u2019s act is nothing but a charade. It certainly casts doubt on the assertion Azalea spits in the very first line of \\u201cFancy:\\u201d \\u201cFirst things first, I\\u2019m the realest.\\u201d \\n \\n Whoops. \\n \\n Everybody looking at Iggy like\\u2026 pic.twitter.com/cK5VUSzx1j \\u2014 Casey Novak (@Sassie_N_Classi) June 30, 2014 \\n \\n It\\u2019s not as though the curtain hasn\\u2019t come down on Azalea before; when she performed \\u201cFancy\\u201d live on \\u201cDancing With the Stars,\\u201d we saw a prime-time example of code-switching. Azalea, who is Australian, wasn\\u2019t in time with her backing track, and, in the middle of a live performance, switched from her \\u201chip hop voice\\u201d to her real one, saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry, there\\u2019s something wrong with my ear.\\u201d \\n \\n Azalea is the only the second artist after the Beatles to have her first two songs occupy the top two spots on the Billboard chart simultaneously, with \\u201cFancy\\u201d at No. 1 and \\u201cProblem\\u201d at No. 2. \\u201cProblem\\u201d is by Ariana Grande but features Azalea. Minaj\\u2019s insult probably won\\u2019t do much to change that, but it\\u2019s certainly fun to talk about, especially since she provided some much-needed entertainment for a show that couldn\\u2019t seem to get its act together. \\n \\n The network saw fit to honor Lionel Richie with a lifetime achievement award, complete with a three-song tribute from John Legend, Ledisi and Yolanda Adams, and your typical talking head documentary-style commentary on the Commodores.

Now, the test will be whether Clinton can rise above the fray and focus on straight answers to outstanding questions about her handling of the 2012 Benghazi attacks that killed a U.S. ambassador and the private email setup she relied on while in office. \\n \\n Here\\u2019s POLITICO\\u2019s compilation of advice offered by experts of all stripes: \\n \\n Don\\u2019t lie \\n \\n It\\u2019s easy to dismiss a potential future indictment of Clinton for lying to Congress as the fantasy of a fevered conservative mind, but lawyers who prepare witnesses for Capitol Hill testimony say avoiding that unpleasant outcome would be at the top of their list. \\n \\n \\u201cThere\\u2019s a federal law saying you can\\u2019t lie to Congress and you can\\u2019t mislead Congress. It\\u2019s actually not all that unusual for congressional committees to refer people to the Justice Department for alleged false statements,\\u201d said Robert Kelner, a GOP lawyer with Covington & Burling. \\u201cShe\\u2019s going to want to approach this from a political perspective and say things that will be directed to her political supporters, but there\\u2019s a tremendous tension between her political incentives and the advice she must be getting from her lawyers to be extremely factual.\\u201d \\n \\n Prosecutors coming after congressional witnesses over statements made in testimony is far from rare. Pitcher Roger Clemens was indicted in 2010 for testimony he gave about steroids in Major League Baseball. Sure, he was acquitted two years later after a trial, but who wants to go through that? \\n \\n Claims of false congressional testimony have triggered a series of criminal cases in recent years, including one against Steven Griles, a George W. Bush administration deputy secretary of the Interior who was caught up in the investigation into lobbyist Jack Abramoff, and another against former BP executive David Rainey, who was accused of understating how much oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico during the Deepwater Horizon disaster. (Griles pled guilty, while a judge ultimately dismissed the charge against Rainey.) \\n \\n There have also been calls for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to be prosecuted for answers he gave to Congress about the NSA\\u2019s then-classified phone surveillance efforts. He apologized, saying he misunderstood the question. No charges have been filed. \\n \\n The Iran-Contra scandal brought the largest flurry of lying-to-Congress charges in the past few decades, including indictments against Reagan National Security Adviser John Poindexter and Lt. Col Oliver North. Both men were convicted, but had their convictions overturned on appeal. \\n \\n So don\\u2019t shade the truth, even if tempted. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t speculate \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday won\\u2019t be her first public statements on Benghazi or on the email controversy that has dogged her presidential campaign, but she and her advisers have already encountered difficulties with claims made about the email situation that later proved incorrect. \\n \\n \\u201cHer biggest problem is inconsistent statements,\\u201d said one prominent Democratic lawyer, who asked not to be named. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the risk of any person going into a situation like this. This is the stuff of independent counsel investigations.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s campaign said she began using her private Clintonemail.com account on March 18, 2009, but last month the Pentagon produced messages that she exchanged with Gen. David Petraeus on that address weeks earlier. Clinton aides said it now appears that while the server was set up on that March date, the account became active earlier. No one seems sure if or where messages from that period were stored. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s lawyer also told Congress in March that no emails from her account from her tenure as secretary of state \\u201creside on the server or any back-up systems associated with the server.\\u201d However, the FBI reportedly has recovered some of those messages, and recently, a service provider to Clinton\\u2019s information technology contractor revealed that it had back-up of some of the server's contents. \\n \\n Clinton also declared at the outset of the furor in March that she was confident there was no classified information in her account. \\u201cThere is no classified material,\\u201d she told reporters. \\u201dI\\u2019m certainly well-aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.\\u201d \\n \\n Now, the State Department has classified more than 400 of the emails with more to come. And the intelligence community says some contained information that was classified \\u201cTOP SECRET\\u201d or higher at the time. Clinton has since changed her stance to say nothing she received was \\u201cmarked classified.\\u201d \\n \\n Clinton also has said repeatedly there\\u2019s no indication anyone tried to breach her server\\u2019s security, But a Senate committee found evidence of potential intrusions from China S. Korea and Germany after she left office but while the server still contained her email archive. \\n \\n For both political and legal reasons, Clinton needs to avoid making any more declarations that are later overtaken by the facts. \\n \\n \\u201cIn life, you never know what you don\\u2019t know, therefore you need to be careful not to go out on a limb to assert facts that are not rock solid,\\u201d said Ron Weich, dean of the University of Baltimore Law School and formerly the Justice Department\\u2019s top adviser to officials testifying on the Hill. \\n \\n Expect Clinton to deflect to others as often as she can, relaying what others told her about Benghazi or her emails. She did just this in August, submitting a declaration under penalty of perjury that appeared to certify all her work related emails had been turned over to the State Department. But on closer examination, it said simply that \\u201con information and belief\\u201d others did the review. \\n \\n Given that her emails already made public show her struggling with technology like fax machines, one easy out for Clinton will be to profess ignorance about any technical questions about her computer setup. \\n \\n \\u201cI think you will hear a lot of caveats,\\u201d Kelner said. \\n \\n Don\\u2019t rile the FBI \\n \\n The FBI team investigating potential security breaches involving Clinton\\u2019s private server will undoubtedly tune in to her testimony. Officially there\\u2019s no indication that Clinton is the target of the inquiry or even that it\\u2019s a criminal probe. \\n \\n Clinton would be wise not to follow President Barack Obama\\u2019s example of dismissing the idea that the private server posed any national security threat, lawyers said. \\u201cThis is not a situation in which America\\u2019s national security was endangered,\\u201d Obama declared recently on CBS\\u2019s \\u201c60 Minutes.\\u201d The comment reportedly angered FBI agents working on the inquiry into Clinton\\u2019s server because it seemed to prejudge the outcome of their probe. \\n \\n Experts urged Clinton to treat the classification issue seriously, even as she maintains she didn\\u2019t knowingly handle anything classified on her private account. \\n \\n \\u201cShe needs to say she takes this seriously, that this is something that needs to be looked at by the appropriate agencies and, hopefully, lessons learned are derived from this,\\u201d said Mark Zaid, a lawyer who represents intelligence agency personnel.

I would have never done that, and if I were President and there were Republicans or Democrats who were thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down.\\u201d \\n \\n At a Senate Benghazi hearing in 2013, a frustrated outburst from Clinton grabbed headlines. \\\"Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night and decided they\\u2019d go kill some Americans?\\\" Clinton said. \\\"What difference \\u2013 at this point, what difference does it make?\\\" \\n \\n \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s campaign has taken a decidedly combative tone with the Benghazi panel recently, shifting away from litigating facts of the email dispute and towards heated claims that Gowdy\\u2019s effort is brazenly partisan.

Clinton is taking center stage as the star witness in the Republican-led... (Associated Press) \\n \\n Clinton, the Democratic front-runner for president, testifies from a position of political strength as her potential rival for the nomination, Vice President Joe Biden, announced Wednesday that he will not jump into the presidential race and she rides the momentum of a solid debate performance. \\n \\n In advance of her testimony, Clinton campaign released a summary that said she is appearing before the committee to honor the memory of the four Americans killed in Benghazi. The summary said Clinton will testify that Benghazi was a tragedy that must be learned from but that America must continue to lead in a dangerous world. \\n \\n \\\"To do otherwise would mean drawing the wrong lesson from Benghazi,\\\" she will say, according to the summary. \\n \\n Clinton will vow to pursue a \\\"smart brand of leadership\\\" that balances diplomacy, development and defense, and will say this approach to diplomacy involves an element of risk-taking that can never be eliminated outright. \\n \\n At the same time, the Benghazi committee is on the defensive as the panel's GOP chairman scrambles to deflect comments by fellow Republicans that the inquiry is aimed at hurting Clinton's presidential bid. \\n \\n Clinton faces a formidable challenge as she tries to explain security lapses at the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, the slow military response to the violence and the Obama administration's changing narrative about who was responsible for the attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens, and why the attacks were launched. \\n \\n In a high-stakes, day-long appearance that could solidify her hold on the Democratic nomination or raise doubts about her candidacy, Clinton also is certain to face questions about her use of a private email account and server while serving as secretary of state. \\n \\n The committee also faces a make-or-break moment. The panel's chairman, Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, and other Republican investigators know their questioning of Clinton could revive the beleaguered panel's credibility or undermine it even further. \\n \\n A new Associated Press-Gfk poll offers solace to both sides. While the investigation into the attacks is a burning issue for Republicans but not the broader public, Americans are more likely to view the investigation as justified rather than as a political attack on Clinton, the poll finds. \\n \\n Many Americans don't have an opinion about Clinton's handling of the investigation. Four in 10 say they neither approve nor disapprove of how she has answered questions about the attack, while 20 percent approve and 37 percent disapprove. \\n \\n Americans also are divided on Clinton's emails. More than half of those polled view her use of a private server as a minor problem or no problem at all, compared with 1 in 3 who think it is a major problem. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans call it a major problem. \\n \\n Gowdy pledged in a recent interview that the hearing will be \\\"Benghazi-centric,\\\" focused on security before and during the attacks. Some questions on Clinton's emails are likely, Gowdy said, but he maintains that his approach may \\\"shock you with fairness.\\\" \\n \\n Clinton has said the use of a private server was a mistake. \\n \\n The hearing comes amid an escalating partisan feud on the 12-member committee, which has spent more than $4.5 million since its creation in May 2014. \\n \\n Democrats have complained about \\\"selective and out-of-context leaks\\\" that they said mischaracterized testimony by top Clinton aides and other witnesses. They say the panel has devolved into partisan harassment intended to hurt Clinton's bid for president. \\n \\n Gowdy and other Republicans say the panel has been and remains focused on those killed in Benghazi and on providing a definitive account of the attacks. There have been seven previous investigations. \\n \\n \\\"This has never been political for us,\\\" said Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala., a member of the Benghazi panel. \\\"This has always been about finding out the truth.\\\" \\n \\n While Thursday's hearing has drawn worldwide attention, \\\"the investigation isn't solely about Secretary Clinton. She's just one piece of a much larger investigation,\\\" Roby said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said the committee has been a bust. \\n \\n \\\"After 17 months and millions of taxpayer dollars spent, the Select Committee on Benghazi has uncovered nothing that alters our core understanding of the facts as revealed by the other (seven) investigations,\\\" said Schiff, who has called for the committee to be disbanded. \\n \\n \\\"When you consider the committee's obsessive focus on attacking Secretary Clinton, the reason becomes quite clear: the (GOP) majority has little interest in the events in Benghazi except to the degree they can be used to diminish her standing in the polls,\\\" Schiff said. \\n \\n ___ \\n \\n Follow Matthew Daly: http://twitter.com/MatthewDalyWDC ||||| Play Facebook \\n \\n Twitter \\n \\n Embed The 4 Types of Benghazi Attack Lines That GOP Candidates Use 1:11 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \\n \\n By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, Americans say they\\u2019re unsatisfied with Hillary Clinton\\u2019s response to the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, according to results from a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. \\n \\n But a plurality of respondents believe that the congressional investigation into the attack is unfair and politically motivated. \\n \\n And the public is essentially divided over the importance of Clinton\\u2019s private email server, with 47 percent of Americans saying it\\u2019s an important factor in deciding their vote, and another 44 percent saying it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n These findings come ahead of Clinton\\u2019s testimony Thursday before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, where the 2012 terrorist attack, Clinton\\u2019s private email server and allegations (even from fellow Republicans) that the committee was established to hurt Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign will all be subjects of discussion. \\n \\n The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, is seen in flames after an attack that killed four Americans in 2012 while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. ESAM OMRAN AL-FETORI / Reuters \\n \\n And the findings in the poll tend to break down by party line. \\n \\n Forty-four percent of Americans say that they\\u2019re not satisfied with Clinton\\u2019s response to the Benghazi attack in 2012, when Clinton served as secretary of state. That includes 77 percent of Republican respondents, 40 percent of independents but just 14 percent of Democrats. \\n \\n By contrast, 27 percent of Americans are satisfied with her response \\u2013 including 51 percent of Democrats, 18 percent of independents but just 6 percent of Republicans. \\n \\n Read the full poll here. \\n \\n Meanwhile, 36 percent of Americans think the current congressional investigation into the Benghazi attacks is unfair and too partisan (that includes 53 percent of Democrats); 29 percent of Americans believe it\\u2019s fair and impartial (including 50 percent of Republicans); and another 35 percent don\\u2019t know enough. \\n \\n Regarding Clinton\\u2019s private email server, 47 percent say it will be an important factor in their upcoming vote, versus 44 percent who disagree. \\n \\n And once again, these numbers are divided by party: 76 percent of Republicans believe Clinton\\u2019s private server is important to their vote, while 70 percent of Democrats say it isn\\u2019t important. \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s general-election standing improves (slightly) \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll also finds that Clinton has slightly improved her general-election standing. She leads Republican Ben Carson by two points in a hypothetical match up, 47 percent to 45 percent. But a month ago, Carson had a one-point edge over Clinton, 46 percent to 45 percent. \\n \\n Clinton also leads Marco Rubio by one point (46 percent to 45 percent) and Ted Cruz by eight points (49 percent to 41 percent). \\n \\n By comparison, Democratic rival Bernie Sanders is ahead of Carson by one point (44 percent to 43 percent), Rubio by four points (45 percent to 41 percent) and Cruz by 12 points (50 percent to 38 percent). \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll shows a generic Democrat holding a one-point advantage a generic Republican in a presidential contest, 41 percent to 40 percent; it was 38 percent to 38 percent a month ago. \\n \\n Comparing Clinton\\u2019s and Sanders\\u2019 attributes \\n \\n When Democratic primary voters were asked to judge Clinton and Sanders on several different attributes, Clinton\\u2019s top attributes in the poll were being knowledgeable and experienced to handle the presidency (88 percent gave her high marks here versus 56 percent for Sanders) and sharing your positions on issues (71 percent for Clinton, 55 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n Clinton\\u2019s worst attributes among Democratic voters: bringing real change to the direction of the country (58 percent give Clinton high marks here, versus 58 percent for Sanders) and being honest and straightforward (53 percent for Clinton, 72 percent for Sanders). \\n \\n And only 26 percent of all voters give Clinton high marks for being honest and straightforward, compared with 50 percent who give her bad marks -- essentially unchanged from the April NBC/WSJ poll. \\n \\n Democratic Party vs. GOP: In the mainstream or not? \\n \\n The new NBC/WSJ poll also measured which political party was in the mainstream \\u2013 or outside the mainstream \\u2013 on six different issues: \\n \\n Gay marriage: 63 percent said the Democratic Party was in the mainstream on this issue, versus just 29 percent who said that about the Republican Party; \\n \\n Abortion: 54 percent said Democrats were in the mainstream here, versus 33 percent who said Republicans; \\n \\n Climate change: 54 percent mainstream for Democrats, 30 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Immigration: 46 percent mainstream for Democrats, 43 percent mainstream for Republicans; \\n \\n Fiscal issues such as taxing and spending: 47 percent mainstream for Republicans, 42 percent mainstream for Democrats; \\n \\n Guns: 51 percent mainstream for Republicans, 38 percent mainstream for Democrats. \\n \\n Obama job-approval rating: 46 percent \\n \\n Finally, the poll finds 46 percent approving of President Obama\\u2019s job, compared with 49 percent who disapprove -- it was 47 percent-47 percent a month ago. \\n \\n The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted Oct. 15-18 of 1,000 adults (including nearly 400 via cell phone), and it has an overall margin of error of plus-minus 3.1 percentage points. ||||| Photo \\n \\n Q. What is the mission of the House Select Committee on Benghazi? \\n \\n A. The Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi, Libya, as the panel is officially known, was created in May 2014 to look into what happened before, during and after the 2012 attack on two American outposts \\u2014 one belonging to the State Department, the other to the C.I.A. \\u2014 in Benghazi. Seven congressional panels had investigated the attacks, but Speaker John A. Boehner said the administration had covered up what occurred. Democrats said that Mr. Boehner created the committee to serve as a vehicle to undermine Hillary Rodham Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign. \\n \\n Mr. Boehner appointed Representative Trey Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor popular with the conservative wing of the Republican Party, to lead the committee. The panel received little attention until March 2015, when it was revealed that it had been given emails about Libya from a personal email account that Mrs. Clinton had exclusively relied on when she was secretary of state. \\n \\n Q. What questions will Mrs. Clinton face about the Benghazi attacks? \\n \\n A. Lawmakers are likely to focus on Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s response to early warnings of increasingly dangerous security conditions in Benghazi \\u2014 warnings that department officials failed to heed, an independent inquiry into the attack concluded in December 2012. That inquiry sharply criticized the State Department for a lack of seasoned security personnel and for relying on untested local militias to safeguard the compound. But the report did not place blame on anyone higher than the level of assistant secretary. \\n \\n Mrs. Clinton has acknowledged that she was briefed on a series of events that indicated that security in Benghazi was deteriorating in the months before the attack. But she said she had gone along with a recommendation from subordinates that the Benghazi State Department post be kept open and assumed that they would take the necessary steps to protect it. \\n \\n Q:. What do we still not know about the Benghazi attack? \\n \\n A. Republicans contend that the administration has not provided an answer about why Susan E. Rice, the national security adviser who at the time was the United States ambassador to the United Nations, went on national television the Sunday after the attacks and provided an inaccurate account about what occurred. Ms. Rice said that the attacks were spontaneously spawned by an anti-American video and were not preplanned by terrorists. Mrs. Clinton will probably be asked about the administration\\u2019s initial narrative about the attacks. And, she will likely be asked why the administration had Ms. Rice appear on television instead of the secretary herself. \\n \\n Q. If the committee is investigating the attacks, why is Mrs. Clinton going to be asked about her emails? \\n \\n A. The emails about Libya that the committee received had never been provided to any of the congressional committees that investigated the attacks. Mr. Gowdy has said that he has the right to investigate Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s email arrangement because the committee\\u2019s charter calls for him to look into how the administration complied with other congressional inquiries into the incident. Mrs. Clinton and Democrats on the committee have said that Mr. Gowdy has no right to investigate her emails because they are not related to the attacks. \\n \\n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \\n \\n Q. What do the Republicans need to do for the hearing to be considered a success for them? \\n \\n A. The Republicans need to placate their base without appearing overly partisan. It is unclear if they can do both. The base would like to see the committee embarrass Mrs. Clinton and get her to make a significant gaffe or admit to some type of wrongdoing. But if the committee members appear overzealous, they will open themselves up to criticism from Democrats who will argue that the Republicans are just trying to undermine Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s campaign. \\n \\n Q. If Mrs. Clinton is having a good day, what will that look like? \\n \\n A. Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s biggest challenge is to appear composed and patient during many hours of questioning. Some Democrats believe that the Republicans will spend the first several hours of the hearing asking Mrs. Clinton about the Benghazi attacks as a way to wear her down, and then question her about emails in the final round. \\n \\n The last time Mrs. Clinton testified before Congress was in 2013, when she appeared before House and Senate committees looking into the Benghazi attacks. That day, Mrs. Clinton accepted responsibility for the security lapses in Benghazi, but said that requests for additional security at the State Department outpost were not sent directly to her. At one point, she became exasperated with the questioning and said there was too much focus on how the Benghazi attacks had been characterized in their early hours. \\u201cWas it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they\\u2019d go kill some Americans?\\u2019\\u2019 she said, her voice rising. \\u201cWhat difference, at this point, does it make?\\u201d \\n \\n Q. What do we still not know about Mrs. Clinton\\u2019s private email account? \\n \\n A. It is still unclear who at the State Department gave Mrs. Clinton approval to use a private rather than an official government account. It is also unclear why Mrs. Clinton did not hand her emails over to the State Department when she left office in 2013. ||||| Democratic presidential frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was grilled for hours today before the House Select Committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attack in Libya that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. \\n \\n Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \\n \\n Washington observers and political junkies have been fixated on this testimony for months, waiting in anticipation to see what impact it may have on her campaign. \\n \\n The testimony featured fireworks from members of congress on both sides of the aisle and left Clinton in the hot seat for around 11 hours, including breaks, beginning just after 10 a.m. and wrapping at 9 p.m. All told, she spent more than 8 hours testifying. \\n \\n Some of the strongest testimony so far, most likely to be seized upon by critics of Clinton, was the exchange with Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. Jordan pointed to two emails -- the first was a note providing a readout of a call between Clinton and the Egyptian prime minister sent on Sept. 12, 2012, the day after the Benghazi attack. The email quotes Clinton as having said, \\u201cWe know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack -- not a protest.\\u201d \\n \\n This is significant because it is new evidence, directly from Clinton, that supports Republican claims that the administration had strong reasons to believe the attack was planned well before U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice went on television a week later and claimed it was motivated by an anti-Islam video. \\n \\n The second email is from Clinton to Diane Reynolds, an alias used by Chelsea Clinton, on Sept. 11, the day of the attack, in which she wrote, \\u201cTwo of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Qaeda-like group: The Ambassador, whom I handpicked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same tomorrow.\\u201d \\n \\n This email also shows she was making a direct assessment, at least in private, that this had to do with al-Qaeda and not a protest. This is important to Republicans and will serve to further their belief that much of the response to the Benghazi attack was calculated to protect Obama politically. \\n \\n Clinton had a clear response: \\u201cWhen I was speaking to the Egyptian prime minister or in the other two examples you showed, we had been told by Ansar al-Sharia [a militia group] that they took credit for it. It wasn't until about 24 more hours later that they retracted taking credit for it,\\\" she said. \\n \\n Clinton also defended herself by saying she was sorry her version of events didn\\u2019t \\\"fit your narrative.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Why didn't you just speak plain to the American people?\\\" Jordan asked. \\n \\n \\\"I did,\\\" Clinton replied. \\\"If you look at my statement, as opposed to what I was saying to the Egyptian prime minister, I did state clearly. I said it again in more detail the next morning, as did the president.\\\" \\n \\n That was just one exchange in a hearing that began with heated opening statements from Gowdy and the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. Gowdy said that previous investigations into the Benghazi attack were \\u201cnot thorough\\u201d and blamed Democrats on the Benghazi Committee for not taking the current investigation seriously. \\n \\n Cummings fired back in his opening statement. \\u201cClearly, it is possible to conduct a serious, bipartisan investigation. What is impossible is for any reasonable person to continue denying that Republicans are squandering millions of taxpayer dollars on this abusive effort to derail Secretary Clinton\\u2019s presidential campaign,\\\" Cummings said. \\n \\n Gowdy denied those claims directly to Clinton. \\n \\n \\u201cI understand there are people, frankly, in both parties who have suggested that this investigation is about you,\\u201d Gowdy said. \\u201cLet me assure you it is not and let me assure you why it is not. This investigation is about four people who were killed representing our country on foreign soil. It is about what happened before, during and after the attacks that killed them.\\u201d \\n \\n Gowdy said her testimony had been delayed not because they wanted to hurt her politically, but because of her private email account that made it so difficult to request her records from the State Department. \\n \\n \\u201cMadame secretary, not a single member of this committee signed up to investigate you or your email. We signed up to investigate and, therefore, honor the lives of four people that we sent into a dangerous country to represent us,\\\" Gowdy said. \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n In Clinton\\u2019s opening remarks, she reiterated that she knew Ambassador Stevens personally and was the one who asked him to serve in Libya. She said the U.S. government needs bipartisan agreement when it comes to foreign policy, despite disagreements. \\n \\n \\u201cMy challenge to you, members of this committee, is the same challenge I put to myself. Let's be worthy of the trust the American people have bestowed upon us. They expect us to lead, to learn the right lessons, to rise above partisanship and to reach for statesmanship,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Gowdy deferred to one of his colleagues and elected not to conduct the first round of questions. Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Illinois, asked the first questions. He chose to focus on why the U.S. was in Libya to begin with, but the premise of his questions was lost after repeatedly interrupting himself to remark on Clinton\\u2019s use of notes. \\n \\n \\u201cI can pause while you read your notes from your staff,\\u201d Roskam said. \\n \\n Before turning on her microphone Clinton remarked that she is capable of doing more than one thing at a time. \\n \\n Later during the hearing, Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, had a contentious exchange with Clinton on a number of topics. \\n \\n Pompeo asked why no one had been fired after an attack that killed a U.S. ambassador for the first time in over 30 years. He also wanted to know why journalist Sidney Blumenthal had such good access to Clinton, while, as Pompeo alleges, those who worked for her did not share that same access. \\n \\n Clinton said Blumenthal was a friend who was simply sharing information and was not working for the U.S. government. Some of that information she passed on and some she did not, Clinton said. She later said he was not her main adviser on Libya, as many of her critics have alleged. \\n \\n Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Indiana, used email printouts as a prop, suggesting there were not enough emails about certain events leading up to the attack, eliciting a response from Clinton that most of the communication she had was not done over email. \\n \\n Rep. Martha Roby, R-Alabama, tried to pin Clinton down over a Feb. 9, 2012, email from State Department staffers that suggested Clinton was unaware if the U.S. had a presence in Benghazi at all. Clinton said the people who sent that email were not members of her staff and that they got it wrong. \\n \\n \\u201cOf course I knew we had a presence in Benghazi,\\u201d Clinton said. \\n \\n Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, used his time to attack the committee forcefully. He said the committee had an obsession over her email, evidenced by the questions so far. He attacked Gowdy\\u2019s opening statement, saying it offered no new facts, and said he didn\\u2019t think there was a need to form the committee in the first place. He criticized Roskom for using his time to ask a series of questions about why the U.S. was in Libya. \\n \\n \\u201cThat\\u2019s not about Benghazi,\\u201d Smith said, then saying to Clinton, \\u201cThey are making this about you.\\\" \\n \\n In one emotional exchange, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, asked Clinton what it was like \\\"to be the subject of an allegation that you deliberately interfered with security that cost the life of a friend.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Congressman, it's a very personally painful accusation. It has been rejected and disproven by nonpartisan dispassionate investigators,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"Nevertheless, having it continued to be bandied around is deeply distressing to me. I lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been racking my brain about what more could have been done.\\\" \\n \\n ABC News \\n \\n The line of questioning about Sidney Blumenthal that erupted into fireworks between Gowdy and Cummings before the lunch break continued in the afternoon, with Republicans attempting to argue that Blumenthal had unfettered access to Clinton at all times, while someone like Ambassador Stevens did not. Clinton is strongly rejected that assertion, saying Stevens would have had a variety of ways to contact her office. \\n \\n \\\"I have said it before and I will say it again. I'll say it as many times as is necessary to respond. Chris Stevens communicated regularly with the members of my staff. He did not raise security with the members of my staff,\\\" Clinton said. \\\"I communicated with him about certain issues. He did not raise security with me. He raised security with the security professionals. Now, I know that's not the answer you want to hear because it's being asked in many different ways by committee members. But those are the facts, Mr. Chairman.\\\" \\n \\n Democrats on the committee used their time for the most part to question the integrity of the committee. Adam Smith again led the charge. \\n \\n \\u201cThe one thing said that is clearly the farthest from the truth is that this is not a prosecution,\\\" Smith said. \\\"If you listen to the other side, this is unquestionably exactly that -- a prosecution. ... If we can learn something new about what happened in Benghazi, that might be helpful, but right now this committee is not doing a service to the four people who died or their families or to preventing any of these future incidents from happening.\\u201d \\n \\n Later in the hearing, Roskam added a dramatic flare. \\n \\n \\\"What's your responsibility to Benghazi? That's my question,\\\" Roskam said. \\n \\n Clinton replied: \\\"Well, my responsibility was to be briefed and to discuss with the security experts and the policy experts whether we would have a post in Benghazi. Whether we would continue it. Whether we would make it permanent. As I said repeatedly throughout the day, no one ever recommended closing the post in Benghazi.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"No one recommended closing but you had two ambassadors that made several, several requests and here is basically what happened to their requests,\\\" Roskam said, ripping up paper in front of Clinton. \\\"They were torn up.\\\" \\n \\n \\\"Well, that's just not true congressman,\\\" Clinton said. \\n \\n The lead-up to today's testimony has seen vicious political sniping from Democrats on the committee, who have seized on remarks in recent days from two Republican congressman and one former committee staffer, each of whom suggested publicly that the committee has disproportionately focused its attention on attacking Clinton. \\n \\n Gowdy has vehemently denied those claims, calling on his colleagues to \\\"shut up\\\" about what they don't know. Last Sunday, Gowdy said in an interview with CBS he plans to question Clinton about her role in denying requests to increase security at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi prior to the attack. He said thousands of previously unseen emails to and from Stevens obtained by his committee will help inform those questions. \\n \\n The House Select Committee on Benghazi was created in May of 2014 with the purpose of conducting a full and complete investigation of the 2012 attack. Prior to Clinton's testimony today, the committee had held only three public hearings. Most of the testimony it has received so far has come in private sessions. \\n \\n The aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the nearby CIA annex instantly became a source of political tension. President Obama faced questions about the military response, allegations he misled the public about the nature the attack, and lax diplomatic security in a war zone, all as he awaited a vote on his reelection the following month. \\n \\n Numerous investigations and reports were written about what happened both on that night and in the lead up to the attack, and what needed to be done to ensure it wouldn't happen again. Two of the higher-profile reports were conducted by the Accountability Review Board (ARB), convened by Clinton herself who was Secretary of State at the time, and another later on by the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee. \\n \\n In December of 2012, the ARB concluded that there was no protest before the attack (which the Obama administration has previously alleged), that the terrorist bore sole responsibility for the loss of life, and that \\\"systematic failures of leadership and management deficiencies\\\" at the State Department led to an \\\"inadequate\\\" security posture. \\n \\n Clinton was never directly implicated in the report. Clinton has admitted that the State Department could have done more to address security needs in Benghazi prior to the attack, but said those decisions were left to other people and she has denied any wrongdoing. \\n \\n Evan Vucci/AP Photo \\n \\n The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence focused on the CIA's response to the attack following accusations personnel on the ground were instructed to delay their response to the consulate, which was being overrun by militants less than one mile way. The report concluded that no such order had been given, despite contradictory witness accounts given by some contracted security officers who were there that night. It also concluded that a mixed group, including Al Qaeda affiliates, were responsible for the attacks. It found that there had been intelligence to support the administrations claims that the attack was borne out of a protest, but said there was early intelligence to counter that false assessment as well. The report declared itself as the \\\"definitive House statement\\\" on the Intelligence Community's involvement in the Benghazi attack. \\n \\n Get real-time updates as this story unfolds.

Paul Shanley, who was convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, 65 miles west of Boston, after his release from the Old Colony Correctional Center, where he served a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware. His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio's owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install \\\"state-of-the-art\\\" security systems and to make sure every child leaves with an adult. \\u201cIt\\u2019s terrible ... that he\\u2019s moving across the street, but there\\u2019s nobody who is better to be his neighbor than me because all I do is make kids safe,\\\" Lask tells the Boston Herald. As a condition of Shanley's 10-year probation, the AP reports that he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16. Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender, though psychologists citing Shanley's advanced age and health issues concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low. \\\"I'm sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to ... be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe,\\\" says Shanley's lawyer. \\\"Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,\\\" argues an attorney who represented dozens of Shanley's accusers.\",\n          \"\\u2013 Women suffering from a heart attack seem to have a better chance of survival if they're treated by a female doctor, according to a new study in PNAS. Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to Florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5% less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: If 1,000 women went to the ER with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the ER, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the Guardian. So what's going on? \\\"Since heart disease is often cast as a 'male' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do,\\\" says lead author Brad Greenwood. While more research is needed, \\\"the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,\\\" he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10% of the study cases, per Reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment. (Breastfeeding may help the heart.)\",\n          \"\\u2013 A new UN analysis finds that at least 60,000 people have died in the Syria conflict, a \\\"much higher\\\" number than was expected and one that is \\\"truly shocking,\\\" says the UN human rights commissioner. The exhaustive, months-long study compiled data from seven sources to come up with a list of 59,648 names as of November. And because fighting has continued, it's safe to say that number is now above 60,000, Reuters reports. (That's slightly higher than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.) The last UN estimate, in May, had the death toll at more than 10,000. This new estimate finds that deaths were at 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011, but had risen to more than 5,000 per month by this past summer. And the violence continued today with what may have been one of the worst attacks so far, al-Jazeera reports: Dozens were killed when a Syrian warplane fired a missile at a gas station near Damascus where people were waiting in line to fill up their cars.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
